## Reasoning

Compositional generalization problem: how the model can generalize to a novel composition of the data that it never saw during training.

There are two main research directions to solve the problem: some researchers think pre-training bigger models on more data, while others suggest exploiting domain knowledge (and there's a spectrum of different design choices between the two worlds).

To exploit domain knowledge we need to understand the structure of the problem, to find the individual elements we can reason on.
